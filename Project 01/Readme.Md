# Attention:  
After developing part of the code on Jupyter Notebook, we observed eratic behavior. So, after completing the coding, we also developed the same code on PyCharm, as a standby. We up loaded both the Jupyter and Pycharm programs.  

Names of deliverables:  
a) Project1.ipynb: This was written with Jupyter notebook. This creates the following files:

movie_ratings.csv (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShovanBiswas/DATA612/master/Assignment01/movie_ratings.csv)
movie_test_df.csv (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShovanBiswas/DATA612/master/Assignment01/movie_test_df.csv)
After creating the files, we uploaded them to the current github, whose raw addresses are given above. When rest of the program runs, it reads from github.  

b) create_movie_ratings_dataset: This was written with PyCharm. This is a separate program to create the two files movie_ratings.csv, movie_test_df.csv. Likewise, these programs were uploaded to github.  

c) movie_ratings.py: The main processing unit that reads and processes files (movie_ratings.csv, movie_test_df.csv), created by create_movie_ratings_dataset.
